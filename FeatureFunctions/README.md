#
 The feiff.py program demonstrates how to genreate feature functions

 To run:  python fei2ff.py

 The parameters for defining the feature functions are in the "parameter" file.


 This code is assuming that your python is a python 2.7 and that you have the above libraries available on your system.  
 I'm pretty sure only the requests library is not in default installation.

 One you get it to run, try changing the name of the feifilename to see if you can read in different data sets.
