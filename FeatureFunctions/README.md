#Feature Functions Programs

This directory is used for developing feature functions. 

To run:  python fei2ff.py

Current Files
     - fastatomfm3.py : contains routines for calculating atom feature functions
     - fei2ff.py : a simple driver to use fastatomfm3.py with .fei files. you can change the feifilename to read different fei files.
     - parameters : the parameters defining the feature functions.


 This code is assuming that your python is a python 2.7 and that you have the above libraries available on your system.  
 I'm pretty sure only the requests library is not in default installation.
